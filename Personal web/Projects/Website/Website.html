      <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>
      <p class="section-text">This personal website is a project I built entirely from scratch - from the first idea and structure, through the design concept, all the way to the final implementation.</p>
      <p class="section-text">The goal was to create a clean and modern digital space that reflects who I am and where I want to go.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Why I Built This Website</h2>
      <p class="section-text">I created this website because I wanted a professional platform that truly represents my direction - combining AI, data, finance and thoughtful long-term growth.</p>
      <p class="section-text">Instead of relying on standard templates or simple profile links, I wanted a space that shows my work and progress.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">What This Project Taught Me</h2>
      <p class="section-text">Working on this website showed me how much thoughtful design and clear structure can influence the overall experience of a project.</p>
      <p class="section-text">I realized how strongly UI/UX principles affect the way users navigate a page and how naturally each part of the content communicates its purpose.</p>
      <p class="section-text">While creating the layout and animations, I learned that small details often determine whether a website feels balanced and professional.</p>
      <p class="section-text">At the same time, I deepened my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - not only from a technical standpoint, but also in how they work together to create a specific atmosphere.</p>
      <p class="section-text">This website has become a space where I can clearly present my work and direction, and it's a project I plan to continue developing as my skills and ambitions grow.</p>
